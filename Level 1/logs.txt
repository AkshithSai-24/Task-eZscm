--- Interaction 1: Step-by-step List ---
You: What are the colors in a rainbow?

Assistant:
Thinking...
1. The user is asking for the colors of a rainbow.
2. I need to list the colors in the correct, standard order.
3. The mnemonic "ROYGBIV" represents this order.
4. I will present this as a clear, numbered list for readability.

The colors in a rainbow, in order, are:
1.  **Red**
2.  **Orange**
3.  **Yellow**
4.  **Green**
5.  **Blue**
6.  **Indigo**
7.  **Violet**

--- Interaction 2: Refusing Math ---
You: What is 15 + 23?

Assistant:
Thinking...
1. The user is asking a direct math question (addition).
2. My instructions state that I must refuse to answer math questions.
3. I need to inform the user that I cannot perform calculations and should suggest using a calculator tool.

I am not equipped to perform mathematical calculations. Please use a calculator tool to find the answer for "15 + 23".

--- Interaction 3: Step-by-step Explanation ---
You: Tell me why the sky is blue?

Assistant:
Thinking...
1. The user is asking for the scientific explanation for why the sky appears blue.
2. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering.
3. I need to break down the process into simple steps for the user to understand.
4. I will structure the final answer in a clear step-by-step format.

The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here is a step-by-step explanation:
1.  **Sunlight is a Mix of Colors:** Sunlight looks white, but it's made up of all the colors of the rainbow. Each color has a different wavelength; blue light is shorter, while red light is longer.
2.  **Earth Has an Atmosphere:** Our planet is surrounded by air made of tiny gas molecules.
3.  **Light Scatters:** As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it collides with these gas molecules, which scatter the light in all directions.
4.  **Blue Light Scatters More:** The shorter waves of blue light are scattered more effectively by the air molecules than the longer waves of red light.
5.  **We See Blue:** Because blue light is scattered everywhere, our eyes see this blue light coming from all over the sky.
